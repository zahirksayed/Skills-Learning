Public custom GPTs in ChatGPT are specialized versions of the AI that have been created by users for specific tasks. These can range from creative tools to educational assistants. While the specific "top 5" can fluctuate, here is a list of highly-regarded and popular public GPTs, based on various sources and their common use cases:

**Top Public GPTs in ChatGPT**

* **Canva:** This GPT allows you to design various assets like presentations, logos, and social media posts directly within ChatGPT by generating templates and designs that can be opened and edited in Canva.
* **Creative Writing Coach:** This assistant is designed to help writers of all levels by providing feedback on their work, assisting with grammar and style, and helping to generate new ideas to overcome writer's block.
* **Consensus:** An AI research assistant that helps users find, summarize, and cite information from academic papers, making it a valuable tool for students and researchers.
* **DesignerGPT:** This GPT can create and host websites based on a user's prompt, simulating the work of a professional designer and developer.
* **Diagrams: Show Me:** This tool specializes in creating various types of diagrams, such as flowcharts, mind maps, and UML diagrams, and allows for easy editing and downloading.

### Similar or Alternative Options in Gemini

Google Gemini also offers ways to create and use custom AI assistants, though the approach and terminology are slightly different.

**Gems (Custom GPTs in Gemini):**

Gemini has its own feature called "Gems" which functions very similarly to ChatGPT's custom GPTs. You can create your own personalized version of Gemini by giving it specific instructions and a persona. This allows you to tailor the AI's responses and behavior to a particular task or role. For example, you could create a "Running Coach Gem" that only provides training advice and workout plans, or a "Recipe Finder Gem" that specializes in suggesting recipes based on ingredients you have. This feature allows for the same kind of specialization and custom behavior that makes public GPTs so popular.

**Other Alternatives and Features:**

Beyond Gems, Gemini offers a number of built-in features and integrations that serve similar purposes to many popular public GPTs.

* **Code Assistance:** Gemini is deeply integrated with Google Cloud and other developer tools, offering powerful coding assistance similar to a "Code Copilot" GPT. Tools like Gemini Code Assist and Gemini in Android Studio provide code generation, optimization, and debugging help.
* **Research and Data Analysis:** Gemini has advanced research capabilities, including a "Deep Research" feature that can help you dive into complex topics. For data analysis, you can upload various file types, and Gemini can help you analyze and visualize the data, much like a "Data Analysis" GPT.
* **Design and Creativity:** While not a direct 1:1 replacement for the Canva GPT, Gemini has its own image generation model, Imagen 4, which can be used to create high-fidelity images from text prompts. It also offers tools like "Whisk" for visualizing and remixing ideas with text and images, and "Flow" for AI-powered filmmaking.
* **Google Workspace Integration:** Gemini's seamless integration with Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail allows it to act as a productivity partner, assisting with drafting emails, summarizing documents, and creating presentations. This fulfills the role of many productivity-focused GPTs.

In summary, while ChatGPT has a well-established library of public GPTs, Gemini's "Gems" feature provides a direct equivalent for creating custom AI assistants. Additionally, Gemini's core capabilities and deep integration with the Google ecosystem offer similar or even more advanced functionalities for tasks like coding, data analysis, and creative work.
