  - Real-time performance profiling, data migration tools.

**Professional:**  
- Automated backups, health checks, migration pipelines triggered by code changes.

### 10. Debugging & Profiling Tools
- **Debugger:** Breakpoint, step-through, watch variables.
- **Profiler:** Memory/cpu/time traces, detect bottlenecks, leak hunting.
- **Chrome DevTools:** Network, performance, and accessibility audits.

**Practice:**  
- Use remote debugging for cloud/deployed systems.  
- Capture flame graph traces for performance optimization.

## **Advanced Level: Cloud, DevOps, Security & Observability**

### 11. Cloud Platforms
- **AWS / Azure / GCP:**  
  - Use SDKs/CLIs for deployment automation.
  - Adopt microservices, serverless (Lambda),
    managed DBs, autoscaling.
- **CI/CD with Cloud:**  
  - Artifacts, secrets, multi-region deployments, cost/usage dashboards.

**Best Practice:**  
- Infrastructure as Code for reproducible, reviewable environments.  
- Build pipelines for blue/green deployments.

### 12. Configuration Management & Orchestration
- **Ansible / Chef / Puppet / SaltStack:**  
  - Automated server config, multi-environment support (dev/stage/prod), dynamic inventory.
- **Terraform / CloudFormation (IaC):**  
  - Declarative provisioning, drift detection, module reuse.

**Next Level:**  
- Self-healing and scaling infrastructure using auto-remediation scripts.  
- Orchestrate updates with zero downtime.

### 13. Monitoring & Logging
