Below is a **clean, neutral rephrasing** of your question first, followed by a **calm explanation and broader perspective**—without dismissing your feelings.

## Rephrased Question (Plain, Respectful English)

> *After seeing this news, my friends and I are shocked and confused. It makes us question what we are witnessing in our lifetime. Are democracy, values, shame, respect, and justice still alive in the world?
>
> How can a medal meant to honor peace be associated with someone many believe has harmed democratic institutions or supported the seizure of power?
>
> If such events are true, what does this say about the future of democracy and the moral direction of the world?*

---

## First Important Clarification (Very Important)

The statement

> *“Trump gets his peace Nobel – Maria Corina Machado presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to him”*

is **misleading / factually incorrect as presented**.

* **Donald Trump** has **not** received a **Nobel Peace Prize**.
* **María Corina Machado** has **not** won a Nobel Peace Prize and therefore does **not** possess a Nobel medal to give.

What usually happens in such cases:

* Someone may **symbolically gift a replica medal**, token, or personal item
* Or a **political gesture** is exaggerated by media or social media
* Or **propaganda framing** is used to provoke emotional reactions

👉 This does **not** mean the Nobel Committee awarded anything.

## Now, Addressing Your Deeper Concern (The Real Question You’re Asking)

Your question is **not really about a medal**.
It is about **moral confusion in modern politics**.

### 1. Is Democracy Losing Its Meaning?

Democracy today often suffers from:

* **Power over principles**
* **Narratives over truth**
* **Loyalty over accountability**

Many leaders:

* Claim to defend democracy
* While weakening institutions, courts, media, or elections

This creates the feeling that **words like “democracy” are being hollowed out**.

---

### 2. Why Do Such Things Feel Shameless?

Because **global politics has shifted** from:

> “What is right?”
> to
> “What can I get away with?”

In many systems:

* Morality is replaced by **strategic alliances**
* Justice is delayed, diluted, or selectively applied
* Symbols (awards, honors, photos) are used to **manufacture legitimacy**

This does **not** mean values are gone — it means **power often ignores them**.

---

### 3. Is There Still Justice in the World?

Yes — but **not always at the top**.

Justice today survives more in:

* Ordinary people
* Independent journalists
* Whistleblowers
* Courts that still resist pressure
* Citizens who **question instead of worship**

The fact that **you feel disturbed** is proof that **conscience still exists**.

---

## What Is the Future of the World?

### Possible Paths (All Are Happening at Once)

1. **Short-term:**

   * More confusion
   * More propaganda
   * More moral contradictions

2. **Medium-term:**

   * Strong pushback from citizens
   * Institutional reforms in some regions
   * Decline of blind hero-worship

3. **Long-term (Most Important):**

   * The world will not be saved by leaders
   * It will be shaped by **aware, critical individuals**

History shows:

> Empires fall.
> False heroes fade.
> But truth has a long memory.

## One Final Thought (For You Personally)

Feeling disturbed does **not** mean you are weak or negative.
It means you are **morally awake**.

In times like these:

* Don’t lose faith in *values* because of *leaders*
* Don’t confuse *noise* with *reality*
* Don’t let outrage turn into hopelessness
