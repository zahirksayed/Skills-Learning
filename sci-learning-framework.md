### 🧠 1. **Meta-Learning: Learn How to Learn**

| Technique                                                                  | Scientific Principle                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identify subject type (Understanding, Memorization, Language, Application) | Activates relevant brain systems (e.g., declarative vs procedural memory) |
| Set SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable...)                      | Goal-Setting Theory; increases motivation & focus                         |
| Use RANCHO or QAEE for topic-wise planning                                 | Cognitive chunking; helps better encoding and retrieval                   |

| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Spaced Repetition                           | Review at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 7 days…)       |
| 🧠 Memory Palaces & Emotion-Based Storytelling | Used by memory champions to anchor abstract info              |
| 🧠 Mnemonics & Visualization                   | Create acronym, rhyme, or vivid diagram (e.g., TCP/IP layers) |
| 🗃️ Mind Maps & Flowcharts                     | Externalize logic (cause-effect, hierarchy, flow)             |

> *Tool: Anki, RemNote, Excalidraw, Miro*

### 🔄 4. **Output Phase: Retrieval and Creation**

| Action                         | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✍️ Recall without Notes        | Recreate what you learned from scratch                   |
| 👨‍🏫 Teach or Record Yourself | Teach back via Loom video or voice recorder              |
| 🔬 Practice & Apply            | Write small code snippets, diagrams, quizzes             |
| 🎯 Micro Projects              | Real-world use cases with constraints, deadlines         |
| 📑 Take Practice Exams         | Self-testing boosts long-term retention (Testing Effect) |

> **Golden Ratio for Technical Subjects:**
> `Input Time : Output Time = 1 : 2`
> e.g., Study for 30 mins → Reflect + Practice for 60 mins
