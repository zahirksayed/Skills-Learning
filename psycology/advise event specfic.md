Got it 👍
I’ll explain everything in **very simple, everyday English**, and give you **easy rehearsals / activities** you can actually do **in the moment**.
No philosophy, no jargon.

Think of this as **mental fitness for daily life**.

# 1. When Someone Interrupts You While You’re Focused

*(working on computer, gardening, reading, etc.)*

### What’s really happening (plain English)

You’re not angry because they spoke.
You’re angry because **your mind was gripping the task too tightly**.

When focus is tight → interruption feels like an attack.
When focus is relaxed → interruption is just sound.

### Simple rule

👉 **Loosen focus, don’t fight the interruption.**

---

### 🔁 Rehearsal: “3-Second Reset”

Practice this every time someone interrupts you.

**Step 1:** Stop for 3 seconds
Don’t respond immediately.

**Step 2:** Take ONE slow breath
No deep breathing. Just one normal breath.

**Step 3:** Say silently

> “This is not an emergency.”

Then respond or go back to work.

📌 That’s it.

Do this **every time**, even if you’re annoyed.
After a few weeks, irritation drops automatically.

---

### Extra daily practice (2 minutes)

Once a day, **intentionally allow interruption**:

* Keep phone near you
* Let a notification sound play
* Don’t react for 5 seconds

You’re training your brain to stay calm **even when broken focus happens**.

---

# 2. Forgetting Names of People or Places

### What’s really happening

You’re trying to **force memory**, and force makes memory worse.

Memory works better when:

* You feel
* You notice
* You relax

Not when you push.

---

### Simple rule

👉 **Attach names to something real, not repetition.**

---

### 🔁 Rehearsal: “One Hook Method”

When meeting someone:

**Step 1:** Hear the name once
Don’t repeat it 10 times in your head.

**Step 2:** Pick ONE hook
Choose just one thing:

* Face feature
* Voice
* Emotion
* Situation

Example:

* “Raj – calm voice”
* “Anna – bright smile”
* “Park Street – noisy traffic”

**Step 3:** Say the name once aloud (optional)
“Nice to meet you, Raj.”

That’s enough.

---

### Daily memory exercise (1 minute)

Before sleep:

* Recall **3 people** you met today
* Recall **1 detail** about each

No pressure. If you forget, don’t force it.

This gently trains memory **without stress**.

---

# 3. Feeling Drained After Talking, Arguing, Negotiating

### What’s really happening

You lose energy when you:

* Try to win
* Try to convince
* Try to control outcome

Talking becomes tiring when you **carry responsibility for the result**.

---

### Simple rule

👉 **Speak clearly, then let go.**

You are responsible for:

* What you say
  You are NOT responsible for:
* How they react

---

### 🔁 Rehearsal: “Drop the Rope”

Before or during tough conversations:

Silently say:

> “I’ll say my part. I’ll drop the rope after.”

Then:

* Speak slowly
* Say fewer words
* Don’t explain again and again

If you feel heat rising → pause.

---

### After-conversation recovery (2 minutes)

Do this immediately after draining talk:

1. Stop talking
2. Stand or sit quietly
3. Put attention on **feet touching ground**
4. Breathe normally for 5 breaths

No replaying the conversation.

This **stops mental leakage**.
