## Early Adulthood (20-25 Years): Responses

### Education or Career Path Chosen
- **Education:** Diligently completed Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science.
- **Career:** Began with a teaching role, which ended prematurely due to limited communication skills and challenges in managing diverse interpersonal situations. Transitioned to a highly technical role in an IT company as a developer. Excelled in core job responsibilities but invested minimal effort in self-promotion or seeking recognition.[1]

### Independence or Burden
- **Became:** More independent.
- **Details:** Achieved full financial self-reliance, though experienced isolation; managed family expectations single-handedly.[1]

### Discipline Evolution
- **Discipline:** Increased initially but became exhausting over time (noted exhaustion prominent by age 50).
- **Examples:** Established rigorous daily routines and Excel-based tracking systems for work/trading; contributed to eventual burnout from sustained overwork.[1]

### Social Withdrawal
- **Continued or Changed:** Partially changed.
- **Level:** Predominantly withdrawn; maintained limited interactions even in trader communities.[1]

### Major Turning Points, Failures, or Realizations
- **Turning Point:** Secured key professional achievements and a 5-year offshore assignment in the USA (later career highlight).
- **Failure:** Worked diligently but failed to strategically showcase strengths, talents, or skills—family members often utilized capabilities without acknowledgment or reciprocity.
- **Realization:** Hard work alone insufficient; recognized need for "smart work," reliable recognition, and a stable recurring income stream. Limited technical job opportunities post-50, compounded by health challenges, heightened financial pressures.[1]

### Emotions: Contained or Surfacing
- **Status:** Started surfacing.
- **Examples:** Experienced internal stress during professional/trading setbacks with minimal external expression; initiated private journaling; actively sought methods to identify and address personal weaknesses.[1]

Pattern reinforces **INTJ/INFJ** (Ni-Te-Fi: strategic depth, disciplined execution, delayed emotional processing). Trading strength: Systematic routines. Risk: Burnout from isolation/overwork.
