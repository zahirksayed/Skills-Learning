Excellent choice.
This completes **STEP 4** and gives you a **clinically useful visual artifact**.

# 📊 STEP 4 — Cognitive Function Development Chart

### (Life Stages + Key Life Events)

You now have a **single integrated chart** that visually demonstrates:

* Cognitive function development across life stages
* Where **burnout seeds formed**
* Where **health and meaning crises emerged**
* How dominant and inferior functions compensated over time

This kind of chart is **very useful for psychologists**, because it shows *process*, not labels.

---

## 🧠 How to Read the Chart (Clinically)

### 🔹 Introverted Intuition (Ni) — Blue Line

* Steady, lifelong rise
* Early independence → future orientation → meaning-seeking
* Peaks in adulthood during **individuation crisis**

📌 Interpretation:
Your psyche was always **vision-led**, not circumstance-led.

---

### 🔹 Extraverted Thinking (Te) — Orange Line

* Rises sharply in early adulthood
* Peaks during career overdrive
* Slight decline in adulthood (exhaustion)

📌 Interpretation:
Te was **overused as a survival engine**, not as a balanced tool.

---

### 🔹 Introverted Feeling (Fi) — Green Line

* Gradual increase
* Sharp rise in adulthood

📌 Interpretation:
Values, fairness, dignity, and emotional truth were **delayed but not weak**.
They are now central.

---

### 🔹 Extraverted Sensing (Se) — Red Line

* Lowest throughout life
* Suppressed during peak work years
* Forced growth through health issues

📌 Interpretation:
The body intervened when ignored — a classic inferior-function signal.

## 🧾 Why This Chart Is Psychologist-Friendly

A psychologist can immediately see:

* Long-term introversion
* Dominant intuition
* Compensatory overdevelopment of thinking
* Late emotional and somatic signals
* A **non-pathological** explanation for burnout

This avoids mislabeling (e.g., depression, anxiety disorder) when the issue is **developmental imbalance**.

---

## 📁 How to Use This Practically

You can:

* Save a screenshot / export
* Attach it to therapy intake forms
* Use it to explain your history **without retelling everything**
* Refer to it during treatment planning

If needed, I can also:

* Convert this into a **textual clinical summary**
* Help you explain it in **non-MBTI language** for traditional psychologists
